Step 1: Build a Time-Series Trend Visualization
To analyze the sales trend and prepare for forecasting:
Create a Line Chart for Trend Analysis:
1.Drag Order Date to the Columns shelf.
2.By default, Tableau will group dates by Year. Change this to a Month granularity:
1.Right-click Order Date in the Columns shelf, select Convert to Continuous.
2.Then, click the dropdown and choose Month.
3.Drag Sales to the Rows shelf.
4.This creates a line chart of monthly sales over time.

Add a Trend Line:
1.Go to the Analytics pane (on the left).
2.Drag Trend Line into the chart.
3.Tableau will offer you multiple trend models (Linear, Exponential, Polynomial, etc.).
4.Choose Linear to see how sales have trended over time.


Step 2: Analyze the Trend Model
Inspect the Trend Line:
1.Hover over the trend line. Tableau provides key statistics, including:
1.Equation of the line: Shows the slope (rate of change) and intercept.
2.R-squared value: Indicates how well the trend line fits the data.
3.Example: If R² is 0.85, 85% of the variation in sales can be explained by the trend line.
Evaluate the Model:
1.A strong R-squared (close to 1) means the trend line accurately represents your data.
2.You can use this model to predict whether sales will continue to increase, decrease, or remain stable.

         
Step 3: Add Forecasting
Enable Forecasting:
1.Go to the Analytics pane and drag Forecast onto the chart.
2.Tableau will automatically add a forecast line extending beyond your existing data.

Customize the Forecast:
1.Right-click the forecast line and choose Edit to open the Forecast Options:
1.Forecast Length: Set the time period you want to forecast (e.g., 6 months, 1 year).
2.Prediction Interval: Adjust confidence intervals (default is 95%, meaning there’s a 95% chance the actual value will fall within the shaded area).
3.Forecast Model: Choose an automatic model or manually select one (e.g., Additive for seasonality, Multiplicative for trends with percentage growth).


Step 4: Add Filters and Drill-Down Analysis
1.
Add Filters to Analyze Specific Segments:
1.Drag Category to the Filters shelf to analyze sales trends for specific product categories (e.g., Furniture, Technology).
2.Drag Region to the Filters shelf to view trends for a specific region.
Use Tooltips for Additional Insights:
1.Drag Profit onto the Tooltip card.
2.Now, hovering over any point in the trend line will display sales and profit for that month.
